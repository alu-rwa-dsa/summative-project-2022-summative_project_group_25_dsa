What does our phone book bring to the table?


  There are many phone books out there and so many versions will be released in the near future,
  but here are some things that we believe make our phone book stand out. Our phone book is user
  friendly which means our older and younger clients can pick up how to use it quickly and our
  working class who are already familiar with how a phone book works, won’t spend so much time adding
  or searching for numbers in the system. The phone book lets you put in the full name and number you 
  want to save into the system, allows you to delete it when you no longer want or need the number, 
  it also allows you to cancel your contacts. Moreover, it allows you to update or edit any number
  you have saved in the system. Additionally, it lets you see all the details of what you’ve saved 
  into the system using the load button. Our phone book is made user friendly by guiding the user
  with pop up message boxes that give instructions on what to do and what you may have done wrong 
  plus how to fix it.
